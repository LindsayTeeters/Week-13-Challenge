# Week-13-Challenge

## Challenge Overview
We are continuing our work with Basil and Sahana. They asked for us to further enhance our earthquake map. They requested to see a map of earthquakes in relation to the tectonic platesâ€™ locations. They also requested to see earthquake with magnitudes greater than 4.5.

In this challenge, we used an open-source JavaScript map library called, Leaflet. Along with Leaflet, we utilized HTML, JavaScript, and D3 to generate our interactive earthquake map.
